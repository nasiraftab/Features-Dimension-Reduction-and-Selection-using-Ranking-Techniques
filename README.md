Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised learning algorithm used primarily for dimensionality reduction and classification. It finds a linear combination of features that best separates two or more classes. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the steps involved:

    Compute the Mean Vectors: For each class, calculate the mean vector of each feature across all instances of that class.

    Compute the Scatter Matrices:
        Within-Class Scatter Matrix: Measures the spread of each class around its own mean, capturing intra-class variability.
        Between-Class Scatter Matrix: Measures the spread between the mean of each class and the overall mean of all classes, capturing inter-class variability.

    Compute the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:
        Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix that results from the inverse of the within-class scatter matrix multiplied by the between-class scatter matrix.

    Select Discriminant Components:
        Sort the eigenvalues and select the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues. These top eigenvectors form the new feature space, maximizing the separation between classes.

    Project the Data: Transform the original data onto the new feature space using the selected eigenvectors, which optimally separates the classes.

LDA is commonly used when there are clear class labels and the goal is to reduce dimensions while maximizing class separability for classification tasks.
